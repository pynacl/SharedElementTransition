You can specify custom effects for entering and exiting fragments and for transitions of shared elements between fragments.

- An enter effect determines how a fragment enters the screen. For example, you can create an effect to slide the fragment in from the edge of the screen when you navigate to it.
- An exit effect determines how a fragment exits the screen. For example, you can create an effect to fade the fragment out when navigating away from it.
- A shared element transition determines how a view that is shared between two fragments moves between them. For example, an image displayed in an ImageView in fragment A transitions to fragment B once B becomes visible.
